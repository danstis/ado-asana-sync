# Feature Specification: Due Date Synchronization

**Feature Branch**: `001-due-dates-a`  
**Created**: 2025-09-06  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Due Dates - A feature to include due dates in the synced items from ADO to Asana. If the work item type has a field for "Due Date" with a value specified, we should copy this value to asana on the inital sync of the item. If this is not the initial sync (the task already exists in Asana or the database) then we will NOT overwrite the value in Asana. This is to ensure we do not overwrite user changes in Asana and loose data."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature involves synchronizing due dates from Azure DevOps to Asana
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: ADO work items, Asana tasks, sync system
   ‚Üí Actions: sync due dates on initial creation only
   ‚Üí Data: Due Date field values
   ‚Üí Constraints: preserve user changes in Asana, one-way sync only on creation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements are clear from description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow for due date synchronization
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable
6. Identify Key Entities (due dates, work items, tasks)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No clarifications needed
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a project manager using both Azure DevOps and Asana, I want due dates from ADO work items to automatically appear in synchronized Asana tasks when they are first created, so that my team can see important deadlines without manual data entry. However, once a task exists in Asana, I want to preserve any due date changes made in Asana to respect user modifications and avoid data loss.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** an ADO work item with a Due Date field populated, **When** the sync process creates a new Asana task for the first time, **Then** the Asana task must have the same due date as the ADO work item
2. **Given** an ADO work item with no Due Date field value, **When** the sync process creates a new Asana task, **Then** the Asana task must have no due date set
3. **Given** an ADO work item with an invalid or malformed Due Date value, **When** the sync process creates a new Asana task, **Then** the Asana task must have no due date set (remains blank)
4. **Given** an existing Asana task that was previously synchronized, **When** the sync process runs again (even if the ADO due date has changed), **Then** the Asana task's due date must remain unchanged to preserve user modifications
5. **Given** an ADO work item type that does not have a Due Date field, **When** the sync process runs, **Then** no due date operations should be performed for that work item
6. **Given** an Asana task is successfully created but due date setting fails, **When** the sync process encounters this error, **Then** the failure must be logged as a warning and sync must continue

### Edge Cases
- What happens when an ADO work item has an invalid or malformed due date? ‚Üí The Asana task will be created with no due date set (remains blank)
- How does the system handle different date formats between ADO and Asana? ‚Üí Dates are converted from ADO format to match the format required by the Asana library
- What happens if the Asana task creation succeeds but due date setting fails? ‚Üí The failure is logged as a warning and sync continues since due dates are low importance

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST detect when an ADO work item has a Due Date field with a populated value
- **FR-002**: System MUST copy the Due Date value from ADO to Asana during initial task creation only
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT overwrite due dates in existing Asana tasks during subsequent synchronizations
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve user-modified due dates in Asana to prevent data loss
- **FR-005**: System MUST handle ADO work items that do not have Due Date fields without errors
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle empty, null, or invalid Due Date values in ADO work items gracefully by creating Asana tasks with no due date
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain a record of whether a task sync is initial or subsequent to determine due date behavior
- **FR-008**: System MUST convert Due Date values from ADO format to the format required by the Asana library
- **FR-009**: System MUST log due date setting failures as warnings and continue sync operation since due dates are low importance

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **ADO Work Item**: Represents tasks, user stories, or bugs in Azure DevOps that may contain a Due Date field
- **Asana Task**: Represents the synchronized task in Asana that will receive the due date on initial creation
- **Sync Record**: Tracks whether a task has been previously synchronized to determine if due date should be copied
